# 0x03. C - Debugging
## Learning Objectives
* At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
## General
* What is debugging
* What are some methods of debugging manually
* How to read the error messages

## Tasks
### 0. Multiple mains
* Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.
### 1. Like, comment, subscribe
* Copy this main file. Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
### 2. 0 > 972?
* Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
### 3. Leap year
* Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
