## :open_book: Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* What is a dynamic library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it
* What is the environment variable `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and how to use it
* What are the differences between static and shared libraries
* Basic usage `nm`, `ldd`, `ldconfig`
## Tasks
### 0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
Create the dynamic library libdynamic.so containing all the functions listed.
### 1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future
Create a script that creates a dynamic library called `liball.so` from all the `.c` files that are in the current directory.
